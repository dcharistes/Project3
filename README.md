# Sorting-algorithms-research
Abstract

In this research, the execution time of three basic sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort) will be studied. To conduct this study experiment, a program in C language has been written where these algorithms will sort numerical arrays of 10,000 up to 100,000 positions with a 10,000 step (meaning that, at first, the algorithm will sort an array of 10,000 then an array of 20,000 and so on). Also, for each dimension (number of positions), the time that each algorithm made to sort the table will be measured and stored for review and analysis. The results of the research will be presented in a table with the corresponding graph and the approximate time-dimension functions each algorithm tends to follow, T(n)=t. The complexity of each algorithm will also be studied.
